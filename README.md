### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm BoogieHasFun, and I like tech, Debug.Log("I can kinda code stuff, I've coded in c# and html!")
### Want to email me?
My **public** email is: ethanpublicemail5007@gmail.com
My 'private' email will not be shown, of course.
### Want to work with me on my code, if I can code later on.
Just make a pull request, fork the repository, help me with the code.
